        "description": "Resolution regarding the use of the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump from office. Submitted by Margolis (TMM7) et al. Expresses concern over Trump's fitness for office, citing \"numerous actions that demonstrate his unsoundness of mind\" and \"increasingly frequent and serious violations of the Constitution.\" Calls for invocation of the 25th Amendment while acknowledging impeachment and the 25th Amendment are \"to all intents and purposes unavailable\" due to political reality. Passed 141-27-20 in a rare anonymous \"counted vote\" after members expressed fears of retaliation.",
